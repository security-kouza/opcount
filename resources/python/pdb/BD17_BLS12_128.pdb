\\ Common Parameters
Sep                  = 128;
Order                = 308;  \\ Group order in bits = size of an Zp element
EmbDeg               = 12;   \\ Embedding degree
ExtDeg		     = 2;    \\ Extension Degree for Group1

\\ Field Arithmetics
FM                   = 225 * Unit;  \\ Multiplication in F_q = (15 words)^2
FI                   = 6*FM; 	    \\ Inversion in F_q (heuristic: not from the paper)
eFM                  = 3*FM;	    \\ Multiplication in F_q^2
eFS                  = 2*FM;
eFI                  = 4*FM+FI;	    \\ taken from [AFCK+13]
TARGET_mul           = 54*FM;       \\ Multiplication in F_q^12
TARGET_square        = 36*FM;
TARGET_inv           = 97*FM+FI;

\\ High-level Functionalities
Miller_Loop          = 7708*FM;
Final_Exponentiation = 6320*FM+6*FI;
