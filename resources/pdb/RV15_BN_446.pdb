\\ BN curve for 192bit security level
\\ Benchmark on Arndale Board (ARM v7), Cortex-A15 at 1.7 GHz
\\ Lower level implementation by NEON language
\\ Numbers are from Table 6.8 (446-bit, Language=N_S, Schoolbook Multiplication)
\\ Projective Coordinate
\\
\\
\\ Base field size = 446 bits
\\ Estimated Security Level = 162 bits?
\\ Group order = 446 bits
\\ Accuracy = []Theoretical Estimation, [x]Real Benchmark, []Toy Example

\\ Numbers are in Clock Counts
