\\ For BD17_xxx.pdb, the unit of timing is 32 x 32bit multiplications.
Unit = 1;


\\ Common Parameters
Sep                  = 192;
Order                = 449;  \\ Group order in bits = size of an Zp element
EmbDeg               = 24;   \\ Embedding degree
ExtDeg		     = 4;    \\ Extension Degree for Group1


\\ Field Arithmetic
FM                   = 324 * Unit;  \\ Multiplication in F_q = (15 words)^2
FI                   = 6*FM; \\ Inversion in F_q (heuristic: not from the paper)
eFM		     = 3*3*FM;
eFS		     = 2*3*FM;
eFI		     = 2*3*FM + 2*2*FM + 4*FM+FI;  \\ from [AFKMR12, Sec.7]
TARGET_mul           = 54*3*FM;
TARGET_square        = 36*3*FM;
TARGET_inv           = 97*FM+FI;    \\ According to Table12 of [BD17]. But it must be 95*FM+FI if we correctly compute from [AFKMR12]. Where does extra 2*FM come from? 


\\ High-level Functionalities
Miller_Loop          = 17127*FM;
Final_Exponentiation = 25187*FM+10*FI;


\\ wNAF window size
\\ Set 0 for searching optimal window size adaptively for every modexp
GROUP0_wNAF          = 0;
GROUP1_wNAF          = 0;
TARGET_wNAF          = 0;
