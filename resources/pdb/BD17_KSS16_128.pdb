\\ Common Parameters
Sep                  = 128;
Order                = 263;  \\ Group order in bits = size of an Zp element
EmbDeg               = 16;   \\ Embedding degree
ExtDeg		     = 4;    \\ Extension Degree for Group1


\\ Field Arithmetic
FM                   = 121 * Unit;  \\ Multiplication in F_q = (11 words)^2
FI                   = 6*FM; 	    \\ Inversion in F_q (heuristic: not from the paper)
eFM		     = 9*FM;	    \\ Multiplication in F_q^4
eFS		     = 6*FM;
